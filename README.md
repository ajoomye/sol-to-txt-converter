# Solidity .sol to .txt Converter & Zipper ðŸ§°

A simple Python script to convert Solidity `.sol` files into `.txt` format while preserving the directory structure â€” then zips the result and optionally copies it to a folder (useful for WSL users to copy to Windows). This is ideal to be uploaded to LLMs such as ChatGPT which cannot read .sol files.

## Features

- Recursively walks through `src/` and `test/` folders from Foundry repo (It can be any folders, change the folder names in the `foldernames` list accordingly.
- Converts `.sol` files to `.txt` with mirrored structure
- Zips the output folders
- Copies the zip files to your destination folder (In the code, it copies from a WSL repo to the Windows Downloads folder)
